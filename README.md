# Travel Agency Site

Hi! This is my first programming project, it is developed with the intention to learn and is based on examples on the internet. It has only learning development purposes and no market use.

The project uses the basics of HTML and CSS.

Nice things that could be learned from this project:

-   Flexbox concepts
    -   The basics of flexbox, like: flex-direction, justify-content and align-items
-   How to integrate with google maps
    -   The site contact section uses a map to show the address, for that we used google maps integration and documentation.
-   Media queries
    -   All the site is responsive for smartphones, tablets and desktops.
